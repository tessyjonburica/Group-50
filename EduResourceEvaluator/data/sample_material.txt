Introduction:
Mathematics is a fundamental subject that helps us understand the world around us. In this lesson, we will explore basic addition and subtraction, which are essential skills for everyday life.

What is Addition?
Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to find their total. For example, when we add 2 + 3, we get 5. This is written as: 2 + 3 = 5.

Examples of Addition:
• 4 + 2 = 6
• 7 + 1 = 8
• 5 + 5 = 10

What is Subtraction?
Subtraction is the process of taking away one number from another. For example, when we subtract 3 from 7, we get 4. This is written as: 7 - 3 = 4.

Examples of Subtraction:
• 8 - 3 = 5
• 10 - 4 = 6
• 9 - 2 = 7

Word Problems:
1. Sarah has 5 apples. She buys 3 more apples. How many apples does Sarah have now?
   Solution: 5 + 3 = 8 apples

2. Tom has 9 marbles. He gives 4 marbles to his friend. How many marbles does Tom have left?
   Solution: 9 - 4 = 5 marbles

Practice Exercises:
Complete the following problems:
1. 6 + 2 = ?
2. 8 - 3 = ?
3. 4 + 5 = ?
4. 10 - 6 = ?

Key Points to Remember:
• Addition combines numbers to find a total
• Subtraction takes away one number from another
• Always check your work by doing the opposite operation
• Practice makes perfect!

Summary:
In this lesson, we learned about addition and subtraction. These are basic mathematical operations that we use every day. Remember to practice these skills regularly to become more confident with numbers.

Assessment Questions:
1. What is the result of 7 + 4?
2. If you have 12 cookies and eat 5, how many are left?
3. Explain the difference between addition and subtraction.

Remember: Mathematics is fun when you understand the concepts and practice regularly!
